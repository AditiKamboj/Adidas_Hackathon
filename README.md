This project predicts optimal shoe Last measurements (insole length, ball girth, heel width, etc.) to reduce Size & Fit related returns labeled as "too small" or "too large".

Objective: Find measurements that minimize return rate for each segment on the basis of sports(football, running, basketball) and gender (male, female).
